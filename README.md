## About The Campus &amp; Community Coalition

The Campus & Community Coalition (CCC) is a collaborative force bringing together university and community partners to address the harms associated with high-risk drinking. By fostering open dialogue, sharing power, and using data-driven strategies, they work to create an environment where everyone can thrive socially, academically, and economically.
